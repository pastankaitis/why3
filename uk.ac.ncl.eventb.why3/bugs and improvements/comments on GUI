Firstly,  perhaps a good idea would be capability to import user written .why format libraries, together withh .tgen format.
Maybe this could be done just by allowing .why format in Translation Definition window under Absolute File Path, though verbally it sounds it should be in Library Theory window. 

Perhaps, for functions, which don't have direct definition, direct definition window could not appear in order not to mislead user with then appearing syntax errors. 

Translation/Formatting: 
	- New line  between different function/predicates. 
	- Move Up/Down function removes other axioms/lemmas instead of changing position, seems to work with Translation rules
	- Not essential, but maybe it would it be possible to have a better structure with newly created functions/predicates and their definition axioms/lemmas, perhaps it would be possible to associate them so, they could 
	  associate with predicates/functions created
	- Range returns set 'a, should set 'b
	- For all functions and relations second input is (set 'b)
	- Range subtraction second term should be (set 'b)
	-
